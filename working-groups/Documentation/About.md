## Whatâ€™s a working group?

A working group is a group of people working together to achieve set goals. The groups are domain-specific and focus on discussion or activity around a specific subject area.

## About the Documentation working group
Documentation Working Group is aimed at developing high-quality user and developer documentation. The Documentation Working group is geared towards making sure that all the important software, tools and projects are well-documented with a standard developer experience defined to help new contributors in getting started with the community.

The Documentation Working Group is specifically used for capability building, bringing onboard new contributors, and helping them to get started, while making sure that the influx of new contributions is not hindered by a lack of good documentation. The next sections of this document describe how the Documentation Working Group is coordinated, and what sort of impact it has in the large and diverse community that makes up moja global.

## Meeting Details

## What is the goal of Documentation working group?
As the name suggests, the primary goal of the Documentation Working Group is to develop documentation for various projects under the moja global umbrella. However, to better understand how to connect our efforts on documentation, an understanding of how documentation is currently developed at moja global is required.

For every project release, a new Documentation plan is created after the epic list for the release is obtained. The epic list describes the bugs that were fixed, the features that were added, and all the trivial/non-trivial changes that were made that hold importance with respect to users and developers. Based on the epic prioritization and bandwidths, the Documentation Working Group commits to documenting the epic list for the release. The Docs Plan is signed off by all the key stakeholders, which includes contributors, ambassadors, coaches and maintainers.

The general documentation development process is very lucid, yet very intuitive, for our use-case. It includes the following steps:

   - **Research**: The documentation research process is an intensive one and we depend on developer inputs while performing the research.

   - **Draft**: Based on the prior research done, a draft can be prepared which is then reviewed by the stakeholders before signing it off.

   - **Review**: After the release of the final draft, the developers/maintainers review the draft and suggest improvements and provide feedback before it is sent as a Pull Request.

   - **Merge**: The documentation is peer reviewed, and after all suggestions are incorporated, the write-up is merged to the official documentation and hosted.


## Tools and technologies
We are yet to decide on the tools and technologies that we will employ for our purpose. However, some of them that are most commonly employed are **Markdown, Docusaurus, Sphinx, ReadTheDocs, Moodle, GitHub Issues, GitHub Project Board**. We also would like to use more efficient project management tools to track our documentation and releases and we are open to suggestions for the same.


## How can I get involved?
The Documentation Working Group is entirely driven by volunteer efforts but we like to keep track of all the contributors who would like to join. It helps us set proper workflows, processes and contribution pipelines that allows us to track the work being done and set realistic timelines. You can pitch for several documentation-specific domains that you would like to contribute to.

We hold a biweekly meeting every second Tuesday at 4:30 PM (IST) / 7:00 AM (EST) / 9 PM (AEST) / 11 AM GMT. If you would like to get involved, feel free to stop by (or anytime!) to introduce yourself. You can also send a message in the [#documentation](https://mojaglobal.slack.com/?redir=%2Farchives%2FC016BNM1NM8) channel of our Slack.
